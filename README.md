**Live demo:** _https://remote-sensing-change-monitor.streamlit.app_  <!-- replace after you deploy -->

A Streamlit app that lets a user draw or upload an AOI, fetch Sentinel-2 L2A imagery by date range, cloud-mask it, compute indices (NDVI, NDWI, NDBI), do simple change detection between two dates, and preview/download results (GeoTIFF + PNG).
